Ingredients:
 - 4 egg whites, at room temperature
 - Pinch of salt
 - 1 cup (220g) caster sugar
 - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 120°C. Line two baking trays with non-stick baking paper.

 2. Use an electric mixer to whisk egg whites and salt until soft peaks form.
    Gradually add sugar, a tablespoon at a time, whisking well between each
    addition, until sugar dissolves.

 3. Once all the sugar has been added, continue to whisk on high for 3 mins.
    Whisk in the vanilla essence.

 4. Use two teaspoons to spoon meringue onto lined trays. Reduce the oven
    temperature to 90°C.

    oven to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
